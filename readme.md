# Compare speeds of languages

Same as https://github.com/niklas-heer/speed-comparison, except:

- writing myself so I can learn the languages
- not including program startup time (which I think speed-comparison does)
- not using Earthly

# todo
- why are c & rust slower than c#????
    - check/optimise c version
    - are impls correct?
    - try profiling & optimising rust impl
